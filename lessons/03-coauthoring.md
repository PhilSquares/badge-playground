# Lesson 3: Co-authoring Commits

## 🎯 Goal
Practice making commits with multiple authors.

## ✅ Steps
1. Clone the repo with a friend.
2. Make a change together (e.g., edit `examples/coauthor-commit-example.txt`).
3. When committing, add this footer to the message:

Co-authored-by: Friend Name friend@example.com


4. Push the commit.
